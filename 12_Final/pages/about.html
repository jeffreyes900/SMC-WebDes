			<p> Reading to Kids is a grassroots organization dedicated to inspiring underserved children with a love of reading, thereby enriching their lives and opportunities for success in the future.  To this end, Reading to Kids gathers on average 554 children and 287 volunteers at reading clubs on the second Saturday of every month at eight Los Angeles elementary schools.</p>
			<p>At the monthly reading clubs, pairs of volunteers read aloud to small groups of children, while their parents receive training on how to encourage their children to read at home.  Kids, parents, teachers, and school libraries receive book donations at the end of the reading clubs.  These are important donations, as 60 percent of low-income homes do not have age-appropriate reading materials for children.</p>
			<p>Since its inception in 1999, Reading to Kids has given 177,421 prize books to children who attend the reading clubs, donated 32,813 hardcover books to school libraries, and our volunteers have spent more than 219,777 hours reading to kids.  Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_to_Kids">here</a> to see our entry on Wikipedia.</p>
			<p>Reading to Kids is incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of the state of California and has been classified as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code. The organization is exempt from both state and federal taxes; our tax ID number is 95-4758698.</p>
