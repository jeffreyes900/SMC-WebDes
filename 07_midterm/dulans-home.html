	      				<h1>Dulan's Soul Food Kitchen</h1>
	      				<h3>Serving up delicious traditional soul food in a cafeteria-style dining experience in Los Angeles since 1999.</h3>
	      				<p class="gd-1-large">Owner Adolf Dulan, the self-proclaimed “King of Soul Food”, has planted deep roots in Los Angeles as a restaurateur over the last four decades with a restaurant collection that started in the late 70s with the beloved neighborhood favorite, Hamburger City. In the early 80s, Mr. Dulan discovered an untapped market for soul food in Marina Del Rey with the wildly successful Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch. Popular among Hollywood celebrities, professional athletes and prominent community members, Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch was the iconic soul food experience in Southern California during the 80s and the 90s. Today, you can experience the warm southern-hospitality and made-from-scratch soul food that the Dulan family legacy is built upon at Dulan's Soul Food Kitchen where Adolf Dulan continues to place a premium on great food, family, and the community.</p>
